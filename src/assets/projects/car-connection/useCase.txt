Load the user page (http://name/#/page/:variable)
	Example is http://carconnection/#/buyer/:buyerID

	I want to call a specific function in the Controller
	that will be used for the variable specific page load.


app.js will:
   loads the controller
	buyerID is being passed to the controller as a variable

	make this decision {
	   foreach (buyers.json) {
		if buyersID = data.buyers.json {
		   name = data.name
		   address = data.address
		}
	   end foreach

   loads the view
