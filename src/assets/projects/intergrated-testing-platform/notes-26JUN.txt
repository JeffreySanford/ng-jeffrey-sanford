(a)  focus on creating an iframe object for each page
(b)  create a design element to hide the views
(c)  create a design element to display the array of errors.

(a)  Focus on Creating an iFrame object for Each Page
    Instead of calling two separate methods to get the information associated with the webpage
    that we are loading, which should be able to refer to the single webpage as an object.

     The code has been stripped down to a simple loop, for four of the pages.

     Implement this code into the loop to attempt to identify one of the javascript files.

     "If your iframe is in the same domain as your parent
     page you can access the elements using document.frames
     collection.

         // replace myIFrame with your iFrame id
         // replace myIFrameElemId with your iFrame's element id
         // you can work on document.frames['myIFrame'].document like you are working on
         // normal document object in JS
         window.frames['myIFrame'].document.getElementById('myIFrameElemId')

    "If your iframe is not in the same domain the browser should prevent such access for security reasons."

Use a prototpye for the webpage object:
